# Programs

Programs are a set of instructions.
If a player has a card describing the program, it is allowed to take this action.


## Send an email

1. Take a piece of paper
2. Write 'to <user>@<machine> from <user>@<machine>' on top, replacing <user> and <machine> with the actual recipient and sender.
3. Write a message below
4. Put the email on the mainframe, with the written side down so that other players cannot read it.
5. Your turn ends

Note: to 'forward' an email, it is permitted to write a header above the original message.

## Use the phone

1. Announce to the other players that you are calling someone and who you are calling. 
	Note: The person you are calling must also have access to the 'phone' program. Who has a phone is considered public information, so you can ask the other players this information in case of doubt.
2. You can now communicate scenario-information with the person you are calling.
3. End your turn
